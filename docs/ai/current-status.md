# Current Status

> Snapshot of where the project is. Update this when state changes.

**Branch**: `claude/rewrite-production-app-e18pD` → PR #1
(`github.com/Samefeeling/MES/pull/1`). Push here; the PR updates itself.
**Do NOT open new PRs.**

**Build health**: `tsc --noEmit` clean · 56/56 Vitest pass · `npm run build`
ok (~76 KB JS / 24 KB gzip).

## Done & working

- Full operator sheet UI (Excel-style), trace view, breakdown cascade,
  multi-fill drag, shift colour themes (Day=blue / Afternoon=green /
  Night=yellow), iPad/elderly sizing, RESERO logo.
- Pure core logic (shifts, status, conflicts, metrics, lock, planning,
  breakdown) — all unit-tested.
- `MemoryDataLayer` — fully working seeded backend (`npm run dev` shows it).
- `SharePointDataLayer` — full implementation against the **real 11 lists**.
  Field map calibrated from actual `diagnoseFields()` / `$top=1` output
  (not guesses). Save-on-signoff writes PMD_Production + PMD_BreakDownlog +
  PMD_Rejects; reads hydrate history back from headers.
- `syncPlanningFromExcel()` — reads the planning `.xlsm` via Graph, clears +
  repopulates PMD_Planning. Wired to ⟳ Refresh + daily auto-sync.
- Reject catalog migrated 21 P-codes → **10 flat D-codes (D01-D10)**.
- SessionStart hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`) installs deps on web.

## Verified against the real tenant

- All 11 SharePoint list field maps confirmed from live schema (2026-05).
- User has updated `PMD_RejectCategories` list to D01-D10.

## Pending / blocked

1. **SPFx deploy — BLOCKED on IT permissions.** `.sppkg` builds; user is
   waiting on App Catalog access + Graph API approval (`Files.Read.All`,
   `Sites.Read.All`). Deploy steps ready in `/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
2. **No end-to-end run against the live tenant yet.** Local dev can't reach
   SharePoint from `localhost` (CORS + SP Origin check 403 — see
   `known-issues.md`). First real validation happens once SPFx is deployed
   (same-origin) OR via the smoke test inside a deployed page.
3. **Graph token wiring** — `window.__pmdGraphToken` is set by the SPFx
   `onInit()` (`aadTokenProviderFactory`). Until SPFx is live, Excel sync
   can't run; list CRUD still works once same-origin.

## Environment config (build-time)

```
VITE_BACKEND=sharepoint
VITE_SITE_URL=https://reseroglobal.sharepoint.com/sites/ReseroOperationsAU
VITE_PLANNING_PATH=Shared Documents/General/Planning/PMD/PMD Schedule_master_epicor 300424.xlsm
```
Default (no env) = `memory`.

## Immediate next action

When IT grants access: follow `/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md § B` (SPFx) → upload
`dist/` to `SiteAssets/pmd/` → run the smoke test in
`/docs/LOCAL_DEV_WITH_SHAREPOINT.md` → report any 400 (field-name) errors.
